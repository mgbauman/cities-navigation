# Cities navigation code challenge

##Instructions
I developed this using a local web server created by my IDE. 

I also tested it using `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` in this directory to run a local webserver on port 8000 because 
python comes preinstalled on Macs. This is an easy way to run this project without opening it in an IDE.

##Results
I believe I met all of the requirements laid out in the instructions PDF file. For the bonus, I went for a simple 
implementation of a 24 hour digital clock to display the time in each of the cities. It starts out showing you the
time in your current timezone and then changes whenever you select another city.
